I have discussions every now and then at work about things like "the process", "owning your work," and such. Every now and then, I'll come across some article that does a far better job than I do of summing these up so I'm keeping track and writing these down. The article, written by Jason Mark, comes from a site I frequent called [Web Designer Depot](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/07/the-10-commandments-of-documentation/). Something I often try to communicate is that good design can mean many things. 

It can mean clear documentation, organized code, and well-thought workflows on the application. It's a lot more than just how the application looks

1. Thou shall not over-document
	* If it takes longer to document than to do, you’re over-documenting.
2. Thou shall automate before document 
	* Take out the human factor whenever possible.
3. Thou shall not muddle through the same thing three times 
	* If you’ve messed up or had to figure out the same thing twice, it’s time to proceduralize.
4. If it’s going to fail, make it fail big 
	* The trickiest things are the things that you miss the first (and even the 10th) time you review them. If you have a choice between creating a process that will stop the assembly line or crash your site if it fails or one that will create a slight error, always choose “take down the site” because at least you’ll spot the problem first time.
5. Thou shall put the process where one must trip over it 
	* because it needs to be found.
6. Own it
	* When following a process, keep in mind your job is to produce the best result. It’s not to follow the process. Always approach it with skepticism and look critically at the results.
7. Admit when it’s not working 
	* Sometimes things might look the same, but they’re not. In our world, we always need standard test data, but the process for creating that in WordPress is completely different than creating it in Drupal, so we need completely different processes.
8. Fix it fast 
	* If your process is out of date, don’t just ignore the issue and wing it, or pick and choose the parts you want to follow. Fix it as you go. It will only take you minutes longer to do in most cases, and those minutes will turn into hours next time you or someone else uses the process.
9. Pick your battles 
	* Steve Krug (the master of usability) says you should test often. Find your biggest problem. Do the LEAST amount of work you can do so that it’s no longer your biggest problem and then repeat. You’re not trying to get any little kink out of the system, you’re trying to get the WHOLE system to run better.
10. Revisit 
	* If you’ve used a process a dozen times and haven’t changed it, you should think about how you can make it more efficient or if you should just automate it.
	
I'm not sure how I feel about #4 but I tend to agree with the rest of the list. Once again, I did not write these and take no credit. Thanks Jason for the great [article](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/07/the-10-commandments-of-documentation/)
